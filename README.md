**Legend :** Fed up with annoying recruitment tasks, Keshav decided to fly to vegas, have some fun, and visit casinos. There are m different casinos in the city. Keshav uses his underworld connections and obtains the data for how much money can be won(or lost) in each casino over n hours on that day. Each casino has a fixed amount of money that can be won or lost over an hour.  
Help Keshav decide when to enter, and when to leave. Return the highest profit that Keshav can earn, assuming that he can only visit one casino over that day.
If he can earn equal profits from two different casinos, we chose the casino where Keshav has to spend less time playing.
